/*
Input format:

First line contains two integers N and K, where N is length of the array and K is window size.

Second line contains of N integers of the array.

Output format:

Print number of distinct elements for every window of size k.

Input:

7 4

1 2 1 3 4 2 3

Output:

3 4 4 3

Explanation:

Window 1 of size k = 4 is 1 2 1 3. 
Number of distinct elements in this window are 3. Window 2 of size k = 4 is 2 1 3 4.
Number of distinct elements in this window are 4. Window 3 of size k = 4 is 1 3 4 2.
Number of distinct elements in this window are 4. Window 4 of size k = 4 is 3 4 2 3. 
Number of distinct elements in this window are 3.
